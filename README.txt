This website is a solo-fullstack project.

Connect as an admin with these logs : 
email : admin@admin.com
pw : AdminAdmin
You can also create your own if you want to. 

To get the database, please follow these steps : 
- find the "linguini.sql" file located in the zipped folder
- install it in phpMyAdmin

If you are connected as an admin, 
you can create new categories and new products. 
But you will have to come back to the page 
(don't refresh it cause it would duplicate the form) 
to make it appear.

For some reasons, clicking on a category brings you to 
a page supposed to show your the products linked to it, 
but it doesnt show any.

The "cart" function isn't working and so is the "orders" section.
